# TO DO LIST 📝

Hey there! 👋

This is a Django project for a simple to-do list application that allows users to register and create their own personalized lists. The project has been developed as a way to practice coding in Django and implement various features. 🖇

Users can create and manage their to-do lists by adding tasks with a name and description. They can remove 🚫 tasks and mark them as complete ✅ by clicking a button. The application also includes a search 🔍 bar where users can search their tasks by name, making it easier to find specific tasks on the list. 🤓

Security 🔒 is an important aspect of the project. Each user's list is private and cannot be accessed by other users. This means that users can freely add and edit their tasks without worrying about other people seeing their list.

If you're interested, I've also included some screenshots 📷 of the project below. These should give you an idea of what the user interface looks like and how the application functions. ⚙️

Thank you for your attention! ✨ If you find this project useful, I would be very happy if you could star ⭐️ it on GitHub. Your support would be greatly appreciated! 💫
