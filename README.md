## Introduction

Hey there, welcome to my 🐍 "Django-Projects" repository!
📚 This semester, I'm taking a course that focuses on the fundamentals of backend web programming with the 🔥 popular Python library - Django.

So, I decided to create this repository to share with you all the projects I'll be working on during this semester and some of my own personal Django projects 💻

 If you find any of the projects useful, please consider giving them a ⭐ to show your support. Thank you for visiting, and happy coding!
